# C# Exercises

## Overview

Provided here will be a set of exercises intended for use by student programmers. 
The programmer will find a set of tests and interfaces to be implemented to satisfy the tests. 

I have had difficulty locating exercises of this nature online and thus have decided to author and collect some here.

Thanks
